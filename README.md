# Angular Coding Style Guide
Best Practices for Scalable and Maintainable Applications

## Abstract
Building robust, maintainable, and scalable Angular applications requires following established best practices. In this session, we will explore key recommendations from the official [Angular Style Guide](https://angular.dev/style-guide) and demonstrate their practical application through a real-world example. Topics will include project structure, component and module organization, coding conventions, performance optimizations, and maintainability strategies. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this presentation will equip you with actionable insights to improve your Angular development workflow and build high-quality applications efficiently.

## Categories of Best Practices
### 1. Single Responsibility Principle
- Define one component, service, or construct per file.
- Improve readability and maintainability.

### 2. Naming Conventions
- Follow consistent naming strategies for files, components, and services.
- Enhance clarity and uniformity across the codebase.
- Angular eslint rules can be found here [rules](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular-eslint/eslint-plugin).

### 3. Coding Practices
- Utilize Angular lifecycle hooks efficiently.
- Use observables for reactive programming.
- Implement robust error handling mechanisms.

### 4. Component and Template Organization
- Structure components and templates for scalability.
- Implement feature modules and shared modules for modular design.

### 5. Styling and CSS
- Use component-specific styles to maintain encapsulation.
- Avoid global styles to prevent conflicts.

### 6. Performance Considerations
- Optimize application performance with lazy loading.
- Reduce change detection cycles for better efficiency.
